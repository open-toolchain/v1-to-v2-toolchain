  This toolchain was created from your [DevOps Services project]({{projectUrl}}). Migration of artifacts from the project to the tools in the toolchain continues for a while after the toolchain is created. Before you use the toolchain, verify the status of the upgrade by reviewing the banner on the [project page]({{projectUrl}}), then refer to [these steps](https:[G'//ｃｏｎｓｏｌｅ.ｎｇ.ｂｌｕｅｍｉｘ.ｎｅｔ/ｄｏｃｓ/ｓｅｒｖｉｃｅｓ/ＣｏｎｔｉｎｕｏｕｓＤｅｌｉｖｅｒｙ/ｕｐｇｒａｄｅ_ｐｒｏｊｅｃｔｓ.ｈｔｍｌ#ｕｐｇｒａｄｅ_next_steps) for what to do next.
