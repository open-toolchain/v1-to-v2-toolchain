name: Project upgrade toolchain
description: "
  A toolchain is an open, extensible system of tools that supports the development, deployment, and operations of an application. Move from a closed system of a few developer tools on DevOps Services to a toolchain that you can customize with tools from any company or team.\n
  
  #### About Your Project\n
  Your project includes GitHub for both source control and work planning and management, a pipeline, and a web integrated development environment (IDE).\n
  
  #### About the Upgrade Process\n
  When you create this toolchain, it is preconfigured with GitHub for source control, Delivery Pipeline for building and deployment, and the Eclipse Orion Web IDE for code editing. You can add more tools to the toolchain as needed.\n\n
  After you create the toolchain, use your DevOps Services project for reference purposes only. If you need to use the project for production purposes, delete this toolchain.\n\n
  To get started, click **Create**.\n
